# Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are a convenient way to automate code formatting, linting, and other checks before committing changes to your repository. This guide will walk you through setting up pre-commit hooks for Python projects using popular tools like Black, Flake8, and more.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which includes pip.

To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
